Virtual Host Creator
===================

Introduction
------------

The people that work with apache always have to create new virtual hosts for their projects. 
This project helps througt cli to create new virtual hosts and enable them.

Configuration
------------
This project was tested in a ubuntu-linux machine, so it uses the ubuntu/debian apache folder layout.
If you have another layout you just have to change the const in the class "src/vhostcreator.class.php".
Is easier to create an alias in your .bashrc file. For this just add this line to your .bashrc file:

	alias vhostcreator='/path/to/VhostCreator/bin/vhostcreator'

Then just run:
	 source ~/.bashrc


Usage
-----
Run:
	xhostcreator
and it will ask your for the your email administrator, servername and documentroot of the virtual host.
